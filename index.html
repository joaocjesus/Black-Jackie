					<strong>Black Jackie</strong>
					<p>
						This is a simple Black Jack game that I made to practise a bit Javascript and jQuery.<br />
						It is far from perfect and probably has a few bugs :).<br />
						If you wish you can get the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/WhiT3Kr0w/Black-Jackie" target="_blank">Black Jackie github repo</a>. <br />
						If you see any errors or want to give some feedback or advice, please let me know.<br />
						Feel free to use any bits of my code. Just give me a nudge so I can feel proud someone is using it.  ;)<br />
					</p>
					<strong>Instructions:</strong>
					<p>
						This is a simple Black Jack game, US style, but without the Split option.<br />
						The purpose of the game is to make bets and try to win some money each hand dealt.<br />
						To win a hand you will need to get as close to 21 points as possible, without exceeding 21. If you get 22 or more you are busted and lose the hand.<br />
						Aces can count as 1 or 11 points, Jacks, Queens and Kings count as 10 points and the remaining cards are counted as their numeric value.<br />
					</p><p>
						Before starting don't forget to check the bet amount.<br />
						Initially the dealer will deal 2 cards for you and 2 for him. Only one of his cards will be visible.<br />
						You will then choose to get more cards, Stand or Double your bet.<br />
						If you double your bet you will get only one more card.<br />
						The dealer will play his hand after you finish playing or you bust.<br />
						He will get more cards until he reaches at least 17 points or busts.<br />
						The one that has the closest to 21 points without exceeding will win the game.<br />
					</p><p>
						A blackjack or natural hand is when the first two cards total 21 points.<br />
						You, or the dealer, will win automatically with a Blackjack, in case the other one doesn't get one as well.<br />
						If you both have a Blackjack then it is a tie/draw, also known as a push.<br />
						21 points done in the third or later card does not count as a Blackjack.<br />					
					</p><p>
						If both of you bust you will lose your bet. The 'house' has advantage.<br />
						If you win you will get the same amount as your bet.<br />
						If you lose, you will get the sum of your bet taken from your money stack.<br />
						If you get a Blackjack you will be paid a 3/2 rate. Which means you will get 150% of your bet. If you bet 5, you will win 7.5.<br />
						If you double and win, you will get twice the amount you placed as a bet.<br />
						If you double and lose, you will lose twice the amount you placed as a bet.<br />
						The Double option will be disabled if you don't have enough money to double the bet.<br />
						<p>Happy gaming!!</p>
